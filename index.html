      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>This specification describes <code>Intent</code> class in Activity
         vocabulary. It is intended to be used in the context of the
         ActivityStreams 2.0 format and provides an extension for the Activity
         Vocabulary to implement intent feature with Activity Streams 2.0.</p>

        <h3>Author's Note</h3>
        <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
        <p>This draft is written to implement intent feature in Mastodon, an
           Activity Streams implementation. This draft is heavily influenced by
           [Activity Vocabulary]. The author is glad to use Mastodon utilizing
           the format, and hope further development and other applications of
           Activity Streams. Some portions of [Activity Vocabulary] are used in
           this document.</p>

      <p>This document was published by the author as a proposal for Mastodon
         and other Activity Streams applications. Please write comments

      <p>This document is expected to be useful also for other Activity Streams
         applications. If you have any request to change for them, please
         contact the author. E-mail is the most reliable means for that, but

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>[Activity Vocabulary] defines Activity class for Activity Streams. This
         document defines vocabulary properties to describe an intent for
         activities represented by the class.</p>
      <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
         " SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
         document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>

      <h2>2. Intent Class</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>2.1 URI</h3>
        <p><code>Intent</code> class is identified with the following URI:
           <code>https://akihikodaki.github.io/activitystreams-vocabulary-intent</code></p>
        <p>The URI is temporary and subject to later change.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>2.2 Subtype and Semantics</h3>
        <p>An intent is a subtype of <code>IntransitiveActivity</code>. An
           intent is about an activity.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>2.3 target property</h3>
        <p><code>target</code> property describes an activity intended to be
           performed.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Example</h3>
        <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
        <pre><code>{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Intent",
  "summary": "Mallory is going to follow someone",
  "actor": "https://example.net/~mallory",
  "target": {
     "type": "Follow"
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>An user agent received the above intent MAY ask Alice the person to
           be followed.</p>
