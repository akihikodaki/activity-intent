        <h3>Author's Note</h3>
        <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
        <p>This draft is written to implement intent feature in Mastodon, an
           [ActivityPub] implementation. The author is glad to use Mastodon
           utilizing the protocol, and hope further development and other
           applications of [ActivityPub].</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>[Intent Class In Activity Streams 2.0 Vocabulary] defines a class named
         <code>Intent</code>. The class does not exist in [Activity Vocabulary],
         which [ActivityPub] relies on. This document extends ActivityPub to
         handle the instance.</p>
      <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
         " SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
         document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>2. Consuming Intents in Clients</h3>
      <p>Clients of [ActivityPub] can consume intents to perform activities
         described with intents.</p>
      <p>Intents MUST be described as an instance of [Intent Class In Activity
         Streams 2.0 Vocabulary]. <code>target</code> property of the instance
         MUST contain a single Activity (which MAY contain embedded objects), or
         a single non-Activity object which will be wrapped in a Create Activity
         by the client.</p>
      <section>
        <h4>EXAMPLE: An Intent</h4>
        <pre><code>{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "https://akihikodaki.github.io/activity-intent/ns#Intent",
  "summary": "Mallory is going to follow someone",
  "actor": "https://example.net/~mallory",
  "target": {
     "type": "Follow"
  }
}</code></pre>
      </section>
      <p>The client then prepares the body of the <code>POST</code> request
         which would be performed in a client to server intraction of
         [ActivityPub]. The body MUST contain an object produced by the
         following procedure or an equivalent. Here, the object is called as
         <i>message</i>.</p>
      <p>If an instance has values for some of <code>actor</code>,
         <code>result</code>, <code>origin</code>, and <code>instrument</code>
         property and <code>target</code> property is an Activity of
         [ActivityPub] without those properties, or a non-Activity object, the
         <i>message</i> MUST be an Activity. If <code>target</code> property is
         an Activity, the property MUST be copied as the <i>message</i>.
         Otherwise, the <i>message</i> MUST be a Create Acitivy of
         [ActivityPub], and <code>target</code> property MUST be attached as its
         <code>object</code> property.</p>
      <p>If an instance does not have values for any of <code>actor</code>
         <code>result</code>, <code>origin</code>, and <code>instrument</code>
         property, <code>target</code> property MUST be copied as the
         <i>message</i>.</p>
      <section>
        <h4>2.1 Wrapping an object in a Create Activity</h4>
        <p>In case the client MUST wrap an object in a Create Activity,
           the client MUST follow the procedure as servers do in client to
           server intractions in [ActivityPub].</p>
        <section>
          <h5>EXAMPLE: An intent with <code>actor</code> and non-Activity
              <code>target</code></h5>
          <pre><code>{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "https://akihikodaki.github.io/activity-intent/ns#Intent",
  "summary": "Mallory is creating a note",
  "actor": "https://example.net/~mallory",
  "target": {
     "type": "Note",
     "content": "This is a note",
     "published": "2015-02-10T15:04:55Z",
     "to": ["https://example.org/~john/"],
     "cc": ["https://example.com/~erik/followers",
            "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public"]
  }
}</code></pre>
          <p>The above example could result in this:</p>
          <pre><code>{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Create",
  "id": "https://example.net/~mallory/87374"
  "actor": "https://example.net/~mallory",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://example.com/~mallory/note/72",
    "type": "Note",
    "attributedTo": "https://example.net/~mallory",
    "content": "This is a note",
    "published": "2015-02-10T15:04:55Z",
    "to": ["https://example.org/~john/"],
    "cc": ["https://example.com/~erik/followers",
           "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public"]
  },
  "published": "2015-02-10T15:04:55Z",
  "to": ["https://example.org/~john/"],
  "cc": ["https://example.com/~erik/followers",

          <h3>3.1 Modification of intents by clients</h3>
          <p>A client MAY edit properties in the <i>message</i>. A provider of
             intents MUST NOT assume an intended activity will be always
             performed without any change.</p>

      <h2>3. Implementation Notes</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>3.1 Unsupported Activities for Intents</h3>
        <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
        <p>Some activities MAY NOT have a clear meaning as intent targets.
           For example, it is quite a unclear that an intent of an intent means.
           Some MAY NOT be simply supported by the receiver as intent
           targets.</p>
        <p>A provider of an intent SHOULD NOT assume a particular activity
           is supported as an intent target by any receivers. A public provider
           of an intent SHOULD provide a fallback in case that the receiver
           could not process the intent.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>3.2 Motivating Use Cases</h3>
        <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
        <p>The main use case of Intent class are deliveries of intents declared at
           locations different from those where the activity to be performed.
           Locations MAY NOT be physical, but they could be Web sites, offline
           storage media, or anything which can save representations of Activity
           Streams.</p>
        <p>For example, Web sites may have a hyperlink to an intent to follow its
           author.</p>
        <p>A person may pass a representation of Activity Streams to someone who
           met offline to make it easy for him or her to follow the person.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>3.3 Advertising the Use of <code>Intent</code> class</h3>
        <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
        <p>A consumer of <code>Intent</code> class SHOULD advertise the use of
           <code>Intent</code> for potential providers.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>4. Security Considerations</h2>
        <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
        <p>This specification does not provide any means to assure authenticity
           of the intent. An intent from an entity and/or through a
           transportation without authenticity MUST be reviewed by the
           actor.</p>
